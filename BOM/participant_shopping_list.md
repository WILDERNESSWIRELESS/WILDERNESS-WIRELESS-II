# Shopping List

## Overview

The Wilderness Wireless Workshop II requires participants to purchase a kit of electronics __*IN ADVANCE*__ of the workshop date of Friday, October 20. This kit will cost ~$125 w/o shipping. Participants will also have to bring $100 in cash to the workshop to pay for the rest of the items necessary for the workshop. In total, the cost of the workshop is ~$225.

We will be working with Raspberry Pi computers in a headless configuration which means it will not have a screen, keyboard or mouse. You will absolutely need a laptop to SSH into the Raspberry Pi for configuration. If you have a laptop running OSX or LINUX, you are prepared. IF you habe a laptop running WIN, you will need to download a SSH application such as PuTTY: http://www.putty.org/

## Things to buy in preparation for the workshop

### Adafruit Industries

The simplest option (maybe not the cheapest) is to use the link below to access the workshop wishlist. With only a few clicks, you can add all the items to your cart and proceed to checkout. The link to the wishlist is here:

If you go this route, you will have everything except the $100 worth of items I will provide when you arrive at the workshop.

Please do this at your earliest convenience! Adafruit is a small hobby-electronics store based in NYC. Items in their store frequently go out of stock, but are usually restocked within a week or so.

IF things do go out of stock at Adafruit, you can still get items via Amazon.

Here are links to some items that might go out of stock that can be had on Amazon:
