# Wilderness Wireless Workshop II Shopping List V1

## Overview

The Wilderness Wireless Workshop II requires participants to purchase a kit of electronics __*IN ADVANCE*__ of the workshop date of Friday, October 20. This kit will cost ~$125 w/o shipping. Participants will also have to bring $100 in cash to the workshop to pay for the rest of the items necessary for the workshop. In total, the cost of the workshop is ~$225.

We will be working with Raspberry Pi computers in a headless configuration which means it will not have a screen, keyboard or mouse. You will absolutely need a laptop to SSH into the Raspberry Pi for configuration. If you have a laptop running OSX or LINUX, you are prepared. IF you have a laptop running WIN, you will need to download a SSH application such as PuTTY: http://www.putty.org/

## In Short, what do I bring to the workshop?

* Laptop with SSH client (installed by default on OSX and LINUX, download [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) for WIN)

* All items from the Adafruit wishlist at this [URL](http://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/437997)
or replacements from amazon or elsewhere if Adafruit is out of stock.

* Two USB cables, 1x MINI, 1x MICRO. These are included in the Adafruit wishlist. If you have your own, you can remove them from the wishlist.

* $100 cash money to pay for the additional items necessary for the workshop.

If you go this route, you will have everything except the $100 worth of items I will provide when you arrive at the workshop.
