 This course explores the materiality of computation through the lens of analog and digital circuitry. Students learn basic electronic theory and circuit design via lecture and gain hands-on knowledge via construction and experimentation in collaborative workshop sessions. Students explore the history and current state of the computational medium through readings and discussion. Students will develop a critical eye towards societal and cultural issues around the concept of computation will and practice electronics construction as a form of critical making. Over the semester, students will research a course-related topic and will communicate their findings to the rest of the class during a presentation in addition to producing a written version. Students will synthesize their knowledge and experiences into a semester-long project. Assessment of the student's progress will be made via midterm and final critiques as well as the quality of research and student participation and attendance.
